## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

Areas that I would like to continue to focus on are semantic HTML, and mobile first design. Semantic HTML isn't a difficult concept, but it's really easy to just use divs for everything. 

Mobile first is really important, it's a pattern than I need to put more focus on learning. 

### Useful resources

- [Semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) - Good way to see what semantic HTML elements I can apply to my projects.
